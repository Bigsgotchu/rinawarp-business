Title: Show HN: RinaWarp Terminal Pro — a local-first terminal with a real agent process

Hi HN — I built RinaWarp Terminal Pro, a desktop terminal with a local agent process that runs alongside your shell.

What makes it different:

**Local-first by default** — terminal works fully offline

**Rina Agent runs locally with:**
- persistent memory (SQLite)
- deterministic next-step planning  
- inline ghost-text suggestions (Tab to accept)
- Optional cloud AI (Agent Pro) for deeper reasoning

**No telemetry, no browser shell, no web wrapper**

The agent is supervised by Electron, survives renderer reloads, and degrades gracefully if cloud AI is unavailable.

I'm shipping Windows first, with macOS/Linux following.

Would love feedback from people who live in their terminal.
