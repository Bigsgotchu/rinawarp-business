## X (Twitter) Thread Content

### Tweet 1/4

🧵 Built a terminal with a local agent process

RinaWarp Terminal Pro runs an agent alongside your shell that learns your workflow and suggests next steps.

Local-first. No telemetry. Optional AI when you want it.

### Tweet 2/4

**[INCLUDE GIF: ghost text demonstration]**

Watch: ghost text appears as you type, press Tab to accept

The agent has persistent memory (SQLite) and plans deterministic next steps based on your current directory and command history.

### Tweet 3/4

No ads. No hype.

This is for developers who live in their terminal and want an agent that actually uses computers instead of just talking about it.

Windows first, macOS/Linux coming soon.

### Response Templates

**For architecture questions:**
"The agent runs as a separate Node.js process supervised by Electron. SQLite for memory, deterministic planning, graceful degradation when AI unavailable."

**For comparisons:**
"Not trying to replace your terminal - different approach for people who want an agent that lives in their terminal, not a web wrapper."

**For limitations:**
"Windows-first launch, Electron dependency adds overhead vs native terminals, new tool means learning curve. Being honest about tradeoffs."
