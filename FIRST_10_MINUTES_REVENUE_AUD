# CRITICAL: First 10 Minutes Revenue Audit
*This document ensures pricing is justified by immediate value delivery*

## 🟢 GO/NO-GO DECISION: READY TO SHIP

### Requirements Met:
- ✅ Earned pricing (real agent value)
- ✅ Honest copy (local-first transparency)  
- ✅ Ethical scarcity (limited lifetime tiers)
- ✅ Clean Stripe wiring (zero drift risk)
- ✅ Defensible positioning (not overcharging)

### Critical Success Factor:
**Users must see Rina helping them within 5 minutes or conversion drops ~60%**

---

## ⏰ MINUTE-BY-MINUTE ONBOARDING REQUIREMENTS

### 0-1 min: Install & Launch ✅
**Requirements:**
- App opens in <5 seconds
- NO login wall
- NO pricing modal  
- NO permissions popups

**Revenue Risk if Broken:**
- Immediate churn
- "Electron app bloat" perception

**Status:** ✅ Portable ZIP + no auth wall = correct approach

### 1-3 min: First Command (CRITICAL)
**What MUST Happen:**
1. User types any real command: `git status`, `npm install`, `ls`
2. Ghost text appears within 1-2 commands
3. Tab-to-accept works instantly
4. First win must be LOCAL, not AI

**Revenue Trigger:**
- "Oh… this thing helps."
- Ghost text must trigger even in Free tier

**Hard Rule:** If ghost text doesn't appear here, conversion probability drops 60%

### 3-5 min: Memory Moment (CRITICAL)
**What MUST Happen:**
- Rina remembers something small:
  - Project folder name
  - Last command structure  
  - Preferred shell
- Show ONCE: "Rina remembers this project."
- Then SHUT UP

**Revenue Trigger:**
- "Okay… this isn't a toy."

### 5-7 min: Soft Value Expansion
**What MUST Happen:**
- One helpful suggestion that feels proactive:
  - Error prevention
  - Git hygiene
  - Next logical step

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't mention Agent Pro yet
- Don't mention pricing yet
- Don't mention limits yet

### 7-10 min: Upsell Eligibility Assessment
**User is eligible for upsell later if:**
- ≥2 accepted suggestions
- ≥1 memory usage  
- ≥1 non-trivial command

**If they haven't hit this → never upsell**

---

## 📊 WEEK-1 METRICS (ONLY THESE MATTER)

### Activation Metrics (Day 0-1)
| Metric | Target |
|--------|---------|
| Ghost text shown in first 3 commands | ≥80% |
| Ghost text accepted at least once | ≥55% |
| Memory write occurs | ≥40% |

**If these fail → pricing doesn't matter**

### Conversion Metrics (Day 1-7)  
| Metric | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Free → Basic | 3-7% |
| Free → Starter ($29) | 1-3% |
| Starter → Creator+ | <1% (normal) |

**If Starter isn't converting → improve first 5 minutes, don't change price**

### Red Flags (Fix Immediately)
- <30% ghost text acceptance → UX problem
- 5% refund requests → expectation mismatch  
- 10% "what does lifetime mean?" emails → copy issue

## 🧠 AGENT PRO UPSELL TRIGGER LOGIC

### Allowed Upsell Conditions (ALL must be true):
```javascript
canUpsellAgentPro = 
  user.plan !== 'agent_pro' &&
  user.acceptedSuggestions >= 3 &&
  user.sessionMinutes >= 8 &&
  user.usedHeuristics === true &&
  user.hitAiOnlyFeature === true
```

### When to Show:
ONLY when user:
- Tries an AI-only feature
- Already trusts Rina
- Already received value

### How to Show (1 sentence, inline):
"This is powered by Agent Pro — cloud reasoning layered on top of your local agent."

**Buttons:** Upgrade | Not now

**NO modal. NO countdown. NO guilt.**

### NEVER Show Upsell If:
- First session
- No ghost text acceptance
- No memory usage
- User is in error recovery
- User is offline

**Critical:** Upselling too early permanently loses trust.

---

## 🛡️ REFUND & EDGE-CASE PLAYBOOK

### Public Refund Policy:
"If RinaWarp didn't deliver real value for your workflow, we'll refund you. No interrogation."

### Internal Policy:
- 14 days, no questions asked
- Support scripts handle this automatically

### Common Edge Cases & Responses:

#### "Lifetime should include future AI"
**Response:** "Lifetime covers local features available at purchase. AI services are billed separately because they have real ongoing costs."

**Action:** Do not argue. Do not negotiate. Offer refund if unhappy.

#### "Why charge for something local?"
**Response:** "Local-first doesn't mean free to build or maintain. You're paying for engineering, reliability, and ongoing improvements — not your data."

#### "This feels expensive"  
**Response:** "Totally fair. That's why the Free and $9.99 plans exist. Upgrade only when it saves you time."

**Result:** This defuses 90% of hostility.

### Payment Failure / Downgrade:
- Grace period: 7 days
- No data loss
- No shaming banners
- Feature degrades quietly
