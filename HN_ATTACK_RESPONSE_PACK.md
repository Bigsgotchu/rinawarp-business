# Hacker News Attack-Response Pack

_Keep this open when you launch pricing_

## Common Attacks & Prepared Responses

### 💰 "This is overpriced"

**Attack:** "$99/mo for a terminal? lol"

**Response:**
Totally fair to question. The core terminal is local and works without cloud. The paid plans fund the agent workflow (deterministic planning, automation, memory) + ongoing maintenance. If you just want a great terminal, Free stays usable.

### 🏷️ "Lifetime is a scam"

**Attack:** "Lifetime is a scam—there's no such thing."

**Response:**
Agreed that "lifetime" can be abused. That's why we define it plainly: lifetime covers the local product + features available at purchase time. If we add optional cloud services later, that's separate. No bait-and-switch.

### 💻 "Electron bloat"

**Attack:** "This is just Electron bloat."

**Response:**
It is Electron, yeah. The tradeoff is cross-platform UI + embedded local agent supervision. We keep core features local-first and measurable; if Electron isn't your jam, totally get it.

### 📊 "Price discrimination"

**Attack:** "Subscription ladder looks like price discrimination."

**Response:**
It's mainly usage segmentation. Light users shouldn't subsidize heavy usage. Also, Free isn't a crippleware funnel—it's intentionally useful.

### 🎤 "Voice is gimmicky"

**Attack:** "Voice in terminal is gimmicky."

**Response:**
For many people it is. That's why it's not in Basic. Creator+ is for users who actually want voice-driven workflows.

### ♾️ "Unlimited is vague"

**Attack:** "Unlimited (fair-use) is vague."

**Response:**
Fair point. We can publish a concrete policy (rate/throughput limits and anti-abuse thresholds) so it's predictable.

### 💳 "Another subscription"

**Attack:** "Why another monthly subscription?"

**Response:**
Because ongoing agent improvements, security updates, and cloud infrastructure cost money. We're local-first, but the agent layer needs servers and development time.

### 📱 "Mobile-first would be better"

**Attack:** "Why desktop-only? Mobile-first is the future."

**Response:**
Terminal work is inherently desktop-oriented. Mobile support could be interesting for monitoring/control, but the core workflow needs keyboard/multi-monitor.

### 🤖 "AI will make this obsolete"

**Attack:** "GPT-4/Claude will make terminal tools obsolete."

**Response:**
Maybe! But we're building the agent layer to work with any LLM backend. If AI makes this obsolete, we'll pivot or open-source what we built.

### 🔒 "Proprietary lock-in"

**Attack:** "Once you're in, you're stuck."

**Response:**
Local-first means you own your data. Export/import tools for workflows. No forced cloud dependencies.

### 💸 "Price anchoring"

**Attack:** "Founder Lifetime at $699 is price anchoring."

**Response:**
It's early-supporter funding, not anchoring. We could have done $99/mo forever, but prefer fewer, happier customers who own their tools.

### 🚀 "Too complex"

**Attack:** "A terminal shouldn't need an agent."

**Response:**
You're right—it doesn't. Free tier proves that. The agent is for people who want automation + assistance. Different needs, different tiers.

## Escalation Responses

### If someone persists on "overpriced"

Look at their profile. If they're a student or indie dev:
"Completely understand. Free tier exists exactly for this. Upgrade only if/when it saves you time worth $29/month."

If they're clearly a enterprise/VC type:
"Pricing reflects real development costs + hosting. If you need enterprise features, we can discuss custom pricing."

### If someone questions lifetime legitimacy

"Fair skepticism. Lifetime means what it says: local product + features at time of purchase. No hidden fees, no forced subscriptions later. We depend on word-of-mouth, not lock-in."

### If someone wants features for free

"Free tier is intentionally useful, not crippled. If you need more, the agent is doing real work (API calls, compute, maintenance) that costs money to provide."

## Redirect Strategies

### To Free Tier

"Try Free first. If it saves you 30 minutes/week, upgrade to Starter ($29). That's the real ROI calculation."

### To Docs

"Full technical details in our docs: https://rinawarptech.com/docs"

### To Comparison

"Here's what $29/mo gets you vs building this yourself: [list specific features]. Compare to hiring a contractor for $150/hour."

### To Timeline

"We're early-stage. Pricing will evolve, but Free tier commitment is permanent."
