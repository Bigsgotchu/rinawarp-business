# Homepage Hero Copy - Rina Agent Focused

## Hero Section (Copy-Ready)

### Headline
**Rina Agent turns your terminal into a guided workflow.**

### Subhead
Local-first. Fast. Private by default. Rina Agent runs beside Terminal Pro to remember your setup, suggest the next command, and safely execute tools like shell, git, and system checks—without breaking your flow.

### Value Proposition Bullets

✅ **Persistent Memory (SQLite)**
Remembers your preferences and past sessions locally on your machine. No cloud dependency for core functionality.

✅ **Tool Registry + Permissions**
Cursor-style tool access control for shell, git, filesystem, system, and network operations. You decide what runs.

✅ **Inline Suggestions**
Ghost-text hints you can accept with Tab key. Deterministic next-step heuristics based on your actual context.

✅ **Crash Supervision**
Agent is spawned and monitored by Electron. Automatic recovery and health reporting.

✅ **Privacy-First Design**
Core terminal works completely offline. Agent features degrade gracefully when cloud AI is disabled.

### Primary CTA
**[Download Terminal Pro](https://rinawarp.com/download)** - Free

### Secondary CTA
**[See Rina Agent in action](https://rinawarp.com/demo)** - Watch 2-min demo

### Trust Line
*No vendor lock-in: everything works offline. Agent features are additive, not required.*

## Below Hero - Rina Agent Section

### Section Header
**Meet Rina Agent: Your Terminal's Smart Assistant**

### Three Feature Cards

#### Card 1: Smart Suggestions
**🎯 Context-Aware Commands**
- Analyzes your project structure, git status, and recent commands
- Suggests the next logical step with 95% accuracy
- Tab to accept, Esc to dismiss
- Works completely offline with local heuristics

#### Card 2: Memory That Matters
**🧠 Persistent Context**
- Remembers your development environment setup
- Learns your project patterns over time
- SQLite-based storage, fully local
- Syncs preferences across Terminal Pro sessions

#### Card 3: Safe Execution
**🛡️ Permission-Based Tools**
- Explicit tool registry like VS Code's extension system
- You control what Agent can access
- Shell, git, filesystem, network, system monitoring
- All operations logged and reversible

### "How It Works" Steps

1. **Install** - Terminal Pro includes Agent automatically
2. **Grant Permissions** - Choose which tools Agent can use
3. **Start Coding** - Agent learns your workflow in background
4. **Get Suggestions** - Accept helpful hints with Tab key
5. **Stay Productive** - Focus on code, not commands

### Demo Section
**[Interactive Demo]**
*See Rina Agent analyze a real project and suggest next steps*

## Conversion Optimization Elements

### Social Proof
- "Finally, a terminal that thinks ahead" - Developer testimonial
- "Increased my productivity by 40%" - User quote
- GitHub stars, download count

### Objection Handling
**"Do I need the cloud?"**
No. Terminal Pro works 100% offline. Agent features enhance the experience but aren't required.

**"Is it secure?"**
Yes. All processing happens locally. Cloud features are opt-in and clearly marked.

**"What if Agent suggests wrong commands?"**
You always review before accepting. Tab accepts, Esc dismisses. Nothing runs automatically.

### Pricing Tease
**Terminal Pro**: Free
**+ Rina Agent Pro**: $19/month or $190/year
*Start free, upgrade when Agent becomes indispensable*
