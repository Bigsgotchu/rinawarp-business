**Post/Thread Content:**

```
🧵 RinaWarp Terminal Pro Linux release is live!

After launching Windows last month, I'm excited to bring the local-first terminal with deterministic AI agent to Linux users.

What you get:
✅ Local terminal with persistent memory (SQLite)
✅ Deterministic AI agent (no hallucinations)
✅ Zero telemetry, privacy-first design
✅ Inline ghost-text suggestions (Tab to accept)
✅ Optional cloud AI for deeper reasoning

Free tier: Basic terminal
Paid tiers: $19/month or $190 lifetime for Agent Pro

Download: https://rinawarp.tech/download

Built for developers who want AI assistance that actually runs on their machine, not in the cloud.

## 💬 Community Engagement Script

### Responding to Questions

**"Does it work on [specific distro]?"**
"Yes! We support Ubuntu/Debian (.deb), Fedora/RHEL (.rpm), and provide AppImage for universal compatibility. Which distro are you using?"

**"How does it compare to [other terminal]?"**
"RinaWarp focuses on AI assistance that runs locally with persistent memory. Unlike cloud-based tools, everything stays on your machine with zero telemetry."

**"Is it really free?"**
"Yes! Basic terminal is completely free. Agent Pro features are optional and clearly marked - you can try them before subscribing."

**"Security concerns?"**
"Agent runs with your user permissions, uses local SQLite for memory, and all operations are logged. No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly enable cloud features."

### Common Linux Concerns
- **Package conflicts** → "Uses standard packaging, shouldn't conflict"
- **System resource usage** → "Electron-based, ~200MB RAM baseline"
- **Integration with existing tools** → "Works alongside your current shell/tools"
- **Update mechanism** → "Built-in updater or package manager"
