## 🎯 DECISION CRITERIA FOR STEP 6 (Agent Pro Flip)

### Only enable Agent Pro UI when ALL 3 are true:

#### ✅ Personal Signal

- You naturally rely on ghost text without thinking about it


#### ✅ Stability Signal

- Zero crashes in 48+ hours
- No stuck terminal states
- No duplicate command execution


#### ✅ Behavioral Signal (local only)

- At least one of:
  - You accepted ≥3 ghost suggestions in a session
  - You noticed memory saving you time
  - You wanted more intelligence, unprompted


**If you don't feel the itch — users won't either.**

- [ ] Ghost text executes twice
- [ ] Tab breaks normal terminal behavior
- [ ] Memory toast fires too often
- [ ] App crashes even once
- [ ] You feel annoyed by the agent

## 🔐 AGENT PRO STATUS: LOCKED

**Current State:** Logic only, no UI calls, no modals, no banners  
**Location:** `apps/terminal-pro/agent/upsell/agentProTrigger.ts`
