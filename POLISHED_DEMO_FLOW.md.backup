## 🎬 Demo Script (60 seconds)

### Setup (5 seconds)

_Show Terminal Pro interface_

- Clean terminal window
- User in project directory
- "Let me show you how Rina Agent helps fix common development problems"


### Step 1: Initial Command (5 seconds)

**User types**: `npm run build`
**Action**: User presses Enter
**Result**: Build starts, then fails

```
> my-project@1.0.0 build
> vite build

✗ Error: Cannot find module 'express'
Require stack:

- /node_modules/express/index.js

```

### Step 2: Agent Analysis (10 seconds)

_Agent icon appears in corner with subtle animation_

**Agent processes**:

- Parses MODULE_NOT_FOUND error
- Checks for package.json
- Verifies node_modules directory
- Analyzes build command context


**Visual feedback**: Agent thinking indicator (subtle pulsing)

### Step 3: Ghost Text Appears (15 seconds)

**User sees**:

- Current command still visible: `npm run build`
- Gray text appears after cursor: `npm install`
- Subtle highlight around suggestion


**UI Text**: "Agent suggests: npm install (press Tab to accept)"

### Step 4: User Accepts (10 seconds)

**User action**: Presses Tab key
**Result**:

- Command line updates to: `npm install`
- Gray text disappears
- Command executes automatically


```
npm install
added 42 packages in 2.3s
```

### Step 5: Next Suggestion (10 seconds)

**After install completes**:

- New gray text appears: `npm run build`
- User presses Tab again


### Step 6: Success (5 seconds)

**Build succeeds**:

```
✓ Build completed successfully
dist/index.html (123 KB)
dist/assets/index.js (456 KB)
```

**Agent confirmation**: Checkmark icon appears
