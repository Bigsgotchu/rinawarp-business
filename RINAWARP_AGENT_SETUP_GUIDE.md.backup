## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Restart VS Code** to load new tasks

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If commands don't work:

```bash
# Check permissions
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Verify installation
bash scripts/health-check.sh
```

### If Continue doesn't work:

- Check `~/.continue/config.yaml` exists
- Restart VS Code
- Verify "RinaWarp Assistant" model is selected


### If VS Code tasks don't appear:

- Restart VS Code
- Check `.vscode/tasks.json` exists
- Open Terminal → Run Task… to verify


## 🎉 Success!
