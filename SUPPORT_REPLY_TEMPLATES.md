## 💬 Payment Declined / Checkout Issue

Thanks for reaching out!

It looks like the payment didn't go through — no charge was completed on our side.

Bank declines are fairly common and usually temporary. Trying a different card or contacting your bank often resolves it quickly.

If you continue to have trouble, let us know and we'll help you sort it out.
