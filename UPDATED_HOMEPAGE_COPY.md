# Updated Homepage Copy - Agent-Focused (No AI Language)

## Hero Section - Revised

### Headline
**Your terminal now has a local agent that thinks ahead.**

### Subhead
Fast. Private. Context-aware. Rina Agent runs alongside Terminal Pro to remember your workflow, suggest the next command, and safely execute tools like shell, git, and system checks—without breaking your flow.

### Value Proposition Bullets

✅ **Persistent Local Memory**
Remembers your development environment and project patterns in SQLite. All stored locally on your machine.

✅ **Tool Registry with Permissions**
Explicit tool access control for shell, git, filesystem, system, and network operations. You choose what runs.

✅ **Contextual Suggestions**
Ghost-text hints that understand your current project state. Tab to accept, Esc to dismiss.

✅ **Execution-Aware Planning**
Agent analyzes command failures, git status, and build errors to suggest fixes and next steps.

✅ **Privacy-First Design**
Core terminal works completely offline. Agent features enhance the experience but aren't required.

### Primary CTA
**[Download Terminal Pro](https://rinawarp.com/download)** - Free

### Secondary CTA

### Trust Line
*No cloud dependency: everything works offline. Agent features are additive, not required.*

## Objection Handling - Agent-Focused

### "Is this another AI chatbot?"
No. Rina Agent is a local execution assistant, not a conversational AI. It analyzes your actual terminal context and suggests commands, not conversations.

### "Do I need internet connection?"
No. Core functionality works 100% offline. Agent features run locally using deterministic heuristics.

### "What if Agent suggests wrong commands?"
You always review before accepting. Tab accepts, Esc dismisses. Nothing runs automatically without your explicit approval.

### "How is this different from VS Code's IntelliSense?"
Rina Agent works at the terminal level, suggesting shell commands, git operations, and system actions based on your actual project state and recent terminal history.

### "Will this slow down my terminal?"
No. Agent runs in background with minimal footprint. Suggestions appear only when relevant.

## Demo Script - One Polished Flow

**Scenario**: npm run build fails → Agent suggests fix → User accepts → Success

1. **User types**: `npm run build`
2. **Build fails** with MODULE_NOT_FOUND error
3. **Agent analyzes** stderr output and project structure
4. **Ghost text appears**: `npm install` (in gray, after current text)
5. **User presses Tab** to accept suggestion
6. **Command executes**: `npm install`
7. **Success message**: Dependencies installed
8. **Agent suggests**: `npm run build` (ready for next attempt)

**Key moment**: When the gray text appears and user presses Tab - that's the magic.

## Marketing Copy Updates

### Replace "AI" with:
- "Local agent"
- "Execution-aware assistant" 
- "Contextual terminal agent"
- "Tool-driven reasoning"
- "Smart terminal companion"

### Avoid:
- "Artificial intelligence"
- "Machine learning"
- "ChatGPT competitor"
- "Conversational AI"
- "Natural language processing"

### Focus on:
- Local processing
- Deterministic suggestions
- Tool execution
- Workflow optimization
- Developer productivity

---

## Product Positioning

**You're not competing with ChatGPT.**
**You're competing with Cursor, Warp, Zed.**

- Cursor: Code editor with AI
- Warp: Modern terminal
- Zed: Fast code editor

**RinaWarp: Terminal with intelligent agent**

Your differentiation is the local agent that understands terminal context and suggests actual commands to run.
