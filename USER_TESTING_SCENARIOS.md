# RinaWarp User Testing Scenarios

## Structured Testing Tasks for Interface Friction Observation

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define specific user testing scenarios to evaluate approachability and identify friction points

---

## 🎯 Scenario Design Principles

### **Testing Philosophy**

- **Real-world tasks**: Use scenarios that reflect actual user needs
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, increase complexity gradually
- **Observable behaviors**: Design tasks that reveal user decision-making
- **Friction triggers**: Include tasks likely to cause hesitation or confusion

### **User Journey Mapping**

Each scenario maps to specific stages of the user journey:

1. **Landing & First Impression** (0-30 seconds)
2. **Initial Interaction** (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
3. **Core Functionality** (2-10 minutes)
4. **Feature Discovery** (10+ minutes)
