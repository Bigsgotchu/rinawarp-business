## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. Missing CSS Styles** ✅
**Problem**: The website looked unprofessional because many CSS classes were missing
- HTML was using classes like `hero`, `container`, `btn`, `card`, `grid`, etc.
- But the CSS file only defined `rw-` prefixed classes
- Result: Unstyled elements looked broken and unprofessional

**Solution**: Added 400+ lines of missing CSS classes including:
- **Hero sections**: Professional typography and spacing
- **Grid system**: Responsive layout with `grid-2`, `grid-3` classes
- **Button styles**: `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-lg` with proper hover effects
- **Card components**: `card`, `card-glow`, `card-soft` with hover animations
- **Typography**: `lead`, `text-muted`, proper heading styles
- **Spacing utilities**: `mb-lg`, `mt-md`, `p-4` etc. for consistent layout
- **Flexbox utilities**: `flex`, `justify-center`, `gap-md` for modern layouts

### **2. Favicon Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect favicon references causing 404 errors
**Solution**: Updated favicon links to use proper `favicon.ico` and icon files

### **3. Professional Styling** ✅
**Improvements Made**:
- Modern gradient backgrounds and color schemes
- Smooth hover animations on cards and buttons
- Professional typography with proper font weights
- Consistent spacing and layout system
- Mobile-responsive design
- Glowing effects and modern UI elements
