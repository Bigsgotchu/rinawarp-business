## Implementation Notes

### Timing Strategy:

- **Soft Lock**: Trigger on feature access attempt
- **Contextual Nudge**: After 2-3 heuristic suggestions used
- **Grace State**: When subscription lapses but grace period active
- **Pricing Clarity**: On-demand or marketing touchpoints


### Design Principles:

- **Non-blocking**: Local agent always works
- **Value-first**: Show what's missing, not what's locked
- **Honest pricing**: No hidden fees or trial traps
- **Graceful degradation**: User experience doesn't break


### Copy Guidelines:

- Use "you" language for direct connection
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Maintain professional but approachable tone
- Always mention local agent availability
- Keep CTAs action-oriented but not aggressive

## Technical Integration

### Trigger Conditions:

```javascript
// Soft lock trigger
if (featureRequiresAI && !user.hasAgentPro) {
  showUpsellModal('soft-lock', featureContext);
}

// Contextual nudge trigger
if (heuristicSuggestionsUsed >= 2 && !user.hasAgentPro) {
  showUpsellNudge('contextual');
}

// Grace state trigger
if (subscriptionStatus === 'past_due' && gracePeriodActive) {
  showUpsellModal('grace-state');
}
```

### Analytics Tracking:

- Modal impressions by type
- CTA click-through rates
- Conversion by upsell type
- Feature usage before/after upgrade


### A/B Testing Variants:

- **Urgency levels**: Different time pressures
- **Benefit emphasis**: Focus on different value props
- **CTA wording**: Action vs benefit-focused
- **Positioning**: Modal vs inline vs sidebar
