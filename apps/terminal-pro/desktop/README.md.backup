## What You Are Building (Plain English)

A terminal-first desktop app with an agent that understands **intent** and safely executes real steps. Local-first, guardrails on by default.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

Use

Type a goal (e.g., Init a Python app and run tests).

Plan → review steps.

Dry-run → see what would run.

Execute → confirm → actions run with allowlist + denials.

Safety

Allowlist commands: echo, git, docker, npm, npx, bash, python, python3, pip, node

Denied patterns: rm -rf /, fork bombs, shutdown/reboot, destructive dd

Execute requires confirmation.


**a.** Want a packaged build via `electron-builder` (dmg/exe/AppImage) next?
**b.** Add a pluggable LLM planner (off by default) behind `RINA_LLM=1`?
```
