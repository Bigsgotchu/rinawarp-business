Title: Show HN: RinaWarp Terminal Pro – Local-first terminal with deterministic AI agent

I'm Karina, and I've been working on RinaWarp Terminal Pro – a local-first terminal that brings deterministic AI agent assistance to your development workflow without telemetry or data collection.

Key features:
• Local terminal with persistent memory
• Deterministic AI agent (no "hallucinations")
• Zero telemetry, privacy-first
• Multi-platform desktop app
• Voice commands (Creator+ tiers)
• Full automation suite (Pro tier)

Free tier: Basic terminal
Paid tiers: $9.99-$99/month or $699-$999 lifetime

What makes this different from AI coding tools:
1. Everything runs locally
2. Deterministic planning (no guessing)
3. Persistent memory across sessions
4. No data leaves your machine

## Day 1 (Tomorrow)

### 🐦 X Thread (9:00 AM PST)
**Post 1/8:**
```
🧵 Thread: I just launched RinaWarp Terminal Pro after 6 months of development.

A local-first terminal with deterministic AI agent assistance.

Here's what makes it different... 👇
```

**Post 2/8:**
```
Most AI coding tools are cloud-based and "guess" their way through problems.

RinaWarp is different:
✅ 100% local
✅ Deterministic planning
✅ Persistent memory
✅ Zero telemetry

Your code never leaves your machine.
```

**Post 3/8:**
```
Demo: Watch the agent transform this messy workflow:

```

**Post 4/8:**
```
The agent can:
• Debug issues systematically
• Suggest optimizations
• Automate repetitive tasks
• Remember your preferences
• Voice commands (higher tiers)

All offline. All private.
```

**Post 5/8:**
```
Pricing:
🆓 Free: Basic terminal
💳 $9.99/mo: Limited AI
💳 $29/mo: Advanced agent modes
💳 $69/mo: Voice AI + higher limits
💳 $99/mo: Unlimited everything

```

**Post 6/8:**
```
Lifetime tiers are limited:
• Founder: $699 (200 spots)
• Pioneer: $800 (500 spots)  
• Evergreen: $999 (unlimited)

Early supporters get priority support.
```

**Post 7/8:**
```
Why deterministic planning matters:

Instead of: "Try this fix maybe"
RinaWarp says: "I analyzed the logs and found X. Here's the exact change needed because Y."

No guesswork. Just results.
```
