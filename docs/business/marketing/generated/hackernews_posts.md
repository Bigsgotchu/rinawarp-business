**Title:** RinaWarp Terminal Pro – AI-powered terminal with real shell integration

**Content:**
I've built RinaWarp Terminal Pro, an AI-powered terminal application that offers real shell integration and advanced features.

**What it does:**

- Real terminal emulation using xterm.js
- AI assistant that suggests commands based on context
- Command blocks and workflow automation
- Split panes and session management
- Plugin system for extensibility

**Why I built it:**
I was frustrated with existing terminal applications that were either too basic or too complex. I wanted something that combined the power of modern AI with professional terminal features.

**Technical details:**

- Built with React and Electron
- Real shell integration using Node.js child_process
- AI integration with multiple providers (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- Enterprise features for teams

Free tier available. Would love feedback from the HN community!
