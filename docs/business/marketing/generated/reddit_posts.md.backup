**Title:** RinaWarp Terminal Pro - AI-powered terminal that's better than Warp

**Content:**
Hey r/programming!

I've been working on RinaWarp Terminal Pro, an AI-powered terminal application that I believe offers significant improvements over existing solutions like Warp.

**Key Features:**

- Real terminal emulation (not just a wrapper)
- AI assistant (Rina) that learns your workflow
- Command blocks and workflows
- Split panes and session management
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Enterprise features (team management, SSO)


**What makes it different:**

- Actually executes real shell commands
- AI that understands context and suggests relevant commands
- Professional-grade features without the subscription complexity
- Open architecture for customization


I've been using it daily for development and it's significantly improved my productivity. The AI suggestions are surprisingly accurate and the real terminal integration means no compatibility issues.

Free tier available with basic features. Would love to get feedback from the community!
