## 🔧 AFTER CREATING PRODUCTS

1. Copy the price IDs from Stripe dashboard
2. Update `backend/src/services/StripeService.ts` with real price IDs
3. Test payment processing


## 💰 PRICING IS NOW CONSISTENT

✅ Frontend: $197, $497, $997 (lifetime)
✅ Backend: $197, $497, $997 (lifetime)
✅ Coin blocking implemented
✅ Users redirected to pricing when insufficient coins

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. Create Stripe products
2. Update price IDs in backend
3. Test payment flow
4. Deploy to production


## 🔧 COIN BLOCKING IMPLEMENTED

✅ **CoinBlocking Component**: Blocks users without sufficient coins
✅ **Music Video Creator**: Now checks coin balance before generation
✅ **Pricing Redirect**: Users sent to pricing page when insufficient coins
✅ **Founder Plans**: Direct links to lifetime plans for unlimited access

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

1. **User tries to generate video** → System checks coin balance
2. **Insufficient coins** → Shows coin blocking overlay with pricing options
3. **User clicks "Get More Coins"** → Redirects to pricing page
4. **User clicks "Founder Plan"** → Redirects to specific founder plan
5. **Payment successful** → User gets unlimited coins for lifetime access


## 🚀 REVENUE FLOW

- **Free users**: Get 10 free coins to try the service
- **Coin users**: Purchase individual coin packages ($2.99-$109.99)
- **Founder users**: Pay once for lifetime unlimited access ($197/$497/$997)
- **Blocking**: Users cannot use features without payment
