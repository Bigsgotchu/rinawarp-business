   - Communicate timeline for removal
   - Provide migration instructions
   - Mark as deprecated in code comments

2. **Grace Period**
   - Minimum 30-day grace period for non-critical components
   - Minimum 90-day grace period for critical components
   - Provide alternatives and migration support

3. **Removal Process**
   - Archive deprecated components
   - Update all references
   - Clean up documentation
   - Verify no remaining dependencies


## Quality Assurance Standards

### 1. Structure Validation

#### Automated Validation Rules

```bash
# Validate no configuration files at root level
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.json" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml"

# Validate script organization
ls scripts/*/*.sh | wc -l == total scripts

# Validate extension uniqueness
ls extensions/*/ | head -1 != duplicates

# Validate asset consolidation
find . -name "favicon*" -o -name "logo*" -not -path "./assets/*"
```

#### Manual Validation Checklist

- [ ] No root-level configuration files
- [ ] Scripts properly categorized
- [ ] Assets centralized in assets/ directory
- [ ] Extensions follow single-source principle
- [ ] Documentation updated for changes
- [ ] Tests pass after structural changes
- [ ] Team notified of changes


### 2. Code Review Standards

#### Structure Review Requirements

- All PRs must include structure impact assessment
- Major structural changes require explicit approval
- Documentation updates must accompany structural changes
- Migration scripts required for breaking changes


#### Review Checklist

- [ ] Changes follow established structure patterns
- [ ] No unnecessary file duplication
- [ ] Proper categorization of new files/directories
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Tests cover structural changes
- [ ] Rollback plan documented for major changes


## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly Tasks

- Review new scripts for proper categorization
- Check for unused or deprecated components

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### 1. Asset Optimization

- **Images**: Compress and optimize before adding to assets/
- **Icons**: Use appropriate formats (PNG for complex, SVG for simple)
- **Fonts**: Host externally when possible, cache when not
- **Videos**: Host on CDN, provide multiple formats


### 2. Script Optimization

- **Performance**: Profile scripts and optimize hot paths
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies
