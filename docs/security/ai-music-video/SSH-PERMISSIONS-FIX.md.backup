# 🔐 SSH KEY PERMISSIONS FIX

## ❌ **ISSUE: SSH Key Permissions Error**

When you try to SSH from Mac to AWS, you get a permissions error because SSH keys need specific file permissions to be secure.

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Set Correct Permissions**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Your SSH Key**

```bash
# Find your SSH key file (usually in ~/.ssh/)
ls -la ~/.ssh/

# Or if you downloaded it to a specific location
ls -la /path/to/your/key.pem
```

### **Step 2: Set Correct Permissions**

```bash
# Set the key file to read-only for owner only
chmod 400 your-key-file.pem

# Alternative: Set to 600 (read/write for owner only)
chmod 600 your-key-file.pem
```

### **Step 3: Verify Permissions**

```bash
# Check the permissions (should show -r-------- or -rw-------)
ls -la your-key-file.pem
```

## 🚀 **COMPLETE SSH COMMAND:**

Once permissions are set, use this command:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key-file.pem ubuntu@18.212.105.169
```

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If Still Getting Permission Errors:**

```bash
# Make sure the key file is in the right location
# And has the correct permissions
chmod 400 your-key-file.pem

# Try with verbose output to see what's happening
ssh -v -i /path/to/your-key-file.pem ubuntu@18.212.105.169
```

### **If Key File is in Wrong Location:**

```bash
# Move it to ~/.ssh/ directory
mv your-key-file.pem ~/.ssh/
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/your-key-file.pem
```

## 📝 **QUICK FIX COMMANDS:**

```bash
# 1. Set permissions
chmod 400 your-key-file.pem

# 2. Test connection
ssh -i your-key-file.pem ubuntu@18.212.105.169

# 3. If successful, check server status
pm2 status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## 🎯 **WHAT TO EXPECT:**

After setting correct permissions:

- ✅ SSH should connect without permission errors
- ✅ You'll be logged into your AWS server
- ✅ You can run diagnostic commands
- ✅ You can restart services if needed


**Try the chmod command first, then attempt the SSH connection again!**
