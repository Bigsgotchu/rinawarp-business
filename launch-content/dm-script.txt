Hey! 👋
I've been quietly building my own AI terminal app called RinaWarp Terminal Pro – it's like a smart assistant for your dev/creator workflows (voice commands, AI models, one-click deploys, etc.).
I'm launching a limited Founder Wave with lifetime licenses and I'd love your support, even if it's just feedback or a share.
Here's the page: https://rinawarptech.com
If you want a license I can hook you up with a founder discount too. 💜
