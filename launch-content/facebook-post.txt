After a year of building, I'm finally launching something I'm insanely proud of.
It's called RinaWarp Terminal Pro — an AI-powered terminal for developers, creators, and power users.
✅ Voice-controlled terminal
✅ GPT / Claude / Groq / Ollama switching
✅ One-click deploy flows
✅ File tree + automation built in

I built this as a solo founder, while juggling life, music, and a lot of chaos.
Today I'm opening the Founder Wave:
🔥 Lifetime license
🔥 Limited seats
🔥 All future updates included

If you want to support me and be part of this from the beginning, grab a Founder license here 👇

Even a share or comment helps more than you know. 💜
