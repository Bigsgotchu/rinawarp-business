# RinaWarp Terminal Pro - Final Launch Sequence

## 🚦 FINAL PRE-LAUNCH CHECK (DO THESE IN ORDER)

### 1️⃣ Run the Windows smoke test once (clean VM)

If any of these fail → fix before launch:

- Agent process not spawning
- Ghost text inconsistent
- License activation brittle
- Offline regression


If all pass → **lock the build hash.**

### 2️⃣ Lock v1 scope (important)

**DO NOT ADD before launch:**

- More AI tools
- More agent autonomy
- More pricing tiers
- More UI polish


**Your v1 promise is already strong:**
Local-first terminal with a real agent process and optional AI reasoning.

That's enough.

### 3️⃣ Launch sequence (recommended)

**Day 0 (morning)**

- Publish Windows installer
- Update homepage CTA → Download for Windows


**Day 0 (afternoon)**

- Post Show HN
- Be present for replies (technical, calm, honest)


**Day 1**

- Post short X thread:

  "Built a terminal with a local agent process"
  1 GIF (ghost text → Tab accept)
  No ads. No hype.

## 💡 What success looks like (realistic, healthy)

**In first 7 days:**

- 1–3 Agent Pro conversions/day
- 2–5 thoughtful HN comments
- 1–2 "this is actually interesting" replies
- Zero Stripe/license incidents


**That's a win.**
