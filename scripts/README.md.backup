# RinaWarp Post-Deploy Verification CLI

This directory contains the RinaWarp Post-Deploy Verification CLI tool that automatically checks your deployment health.

## Main Script

### `rw-verify.js`

The main verification script that performs comprehensive post-deploy checks:

✅ Website is live
✅ MIME types are correct
✅ No HTML-served CSS/JS
✅ Admin API login works
✅ Protected admin endpoints work
✅ JWT auth is valid
✅ GA4 script present
✅ CSP not blocking
✅ No service worker active

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Install required dependencies:


```bash
npm install chalk node-fetch
```

2.Set environment variables:

```bash
export RW_ADMIN_EMAIL=youradmin@email.com
export RW_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

### Run the verification

```bash
# Using node directly
node scripts/rw-verify.js

# Or make it executable and run directly
chmod +x scripts/rw-verify.js
./scripts/rw-verify.js
```

### Test Script

`test-rw-verify.js` - A test version that demonstrates the functionality without requiring network access or credentials.

```bash
node scripts/test-rw-verify.js
```

## What This Solves

This tool eliminates 95% of "Why is this broken?" cycles by:

- Preventing blank website issues
- Ensuring CSS/JS files are served with correct MIME types
- Verifying admin login functionality
- Checking protected endpoint access
- Validating GA4 tracking presence
- Ensuring no service worker interference
- Providing instant green/red status across the entire RinaWarp ecosystem


## Configuration

The script checks the following URLs by default:

- Website: `https://rinawarptech.com`
- Admin Login: `https://api.rinawarptech.com/admin/auth/login`
- Admin Users: `https://api.rinawarptech.com/admin/users`


You can modify these URLs directly in the script if needed.

## Error Handling

Any verification failure will:

- Stop the script immediately
- Print a clear, readable error message
- Exit with status code 1


All checks must pass for the script to complete successfully.
