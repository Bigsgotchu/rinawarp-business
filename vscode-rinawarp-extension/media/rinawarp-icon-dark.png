# Placeholder for RinaWarp Dark Theme Icon

This is an optional placeholder file for dark theme support. You can add this file if you want a different icon for dark VS Code themes.

## To complete the extension (optional):

1. Replace this file with your dark theme `rinawarp-icon-dark.png` (32x32 pixels recommended)
2. Or delete this file if you don't need dark theme specific icons

The extension will use the main icon (rinawarp-icon.png) if this file is not provided.
