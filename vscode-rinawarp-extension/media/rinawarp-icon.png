# Placeholder for RinaWarp Icon

This is a placeholder file. You need to replace this with your actual RinaWarp logo PNG file.

## To complete the extension:

1. Replace this file with your actual `rinawarp-icon.png` (32x32 pixels recommended)
2. Optionally add `rinawarp-icon-dark.png` for dark theme support
3. Ensure both files are in PNG format with transparency

The extension will reference these icons in the package.json configuration.
